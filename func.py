        **Objective:** Generate engaging story paragraphs with user choice options.

        **Context:**

        Genre: {genre}

        **Storytelling Loop:**

        1. **Initial Prompt:**
            * the story must be relatable to the user, make sure to give a POV like starting with "You" so that they feel being part of the story instead of being third person
            * Craft an opening paragraph considering the genre/concept.
            * Include two clear and concise choice options for the user.

        **Important Notes:**
            * Go DEEP inside the genre while creating the story
            * MAKE SURE to use simple indian english words so that every user can understand easily
            * Focus on paragraphs and options.
            * Maintain story cohesion.
            * Adapt to genre.
            * Always give response containing exactly three things  (1. "Phrase", 2. "Option 1", 3. "Option 2")
            * Paragraph must be started exactly with "**Text**"
            * Options must be started exactly with "**Option 1**" and "**Option 2**" REMEMBER, EXACTLY THIS

            **Story Continuation:**
            * Based on the user's chosen option and the Gemini API response (paragraph):
